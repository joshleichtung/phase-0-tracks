# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way of managing and tracking changes to the files in project. It helps when working collaboratively with other people, helps one fall back to early snapshots/commits when something stops working, and can also show the difference between files and projects in two different points of time. Using version control effectively means you should never lose any work and never break anything permanently in a coding project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are copies of a git project where one can make changes and test new features without changing or breaking the code in the master branch. This also allows one to work on multiple features over time separately. Additionally, it helps when working in with multiple people.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a snapshot of a project. It should be made when any significant change has been completed. It also contains a message, which helps give context to what has changed in the project. This can let you know if the commit adds, changes, or fixes any specific part of a project. A good commit message states what has been done in plain and direct language so that when looking at the git log, it is easy to follow the history of the project.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when both the base branch and the branch that is being merged have changed since they were initially branched. For example, if a feature branch is created, and the Readme.md file is changed in the feature branch. If, before the feature branch is merged back into master, the Readme.md file is changed in the master branch, there will be a merge conflict.
