Algorithm for making sure my dog is fed and has water
- I want to make sure my dog gets food twice a day at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm, and I
  want to check to make sure he has water every hour

- For every hour of the day between 7:00am and 10:00pm:
  - If water_bowl.level < .5:
    - Refill water_bowl
  - If time == 8:00am or 8:00pm
    - fill food_bowl
