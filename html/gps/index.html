<h4>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h4>
Semantic tags help give context and meaning to the content inside them. For example, it can delineate content that is meant for navigation, figures and captions, headrs and footers....I think nav, header, and footer are among the most useful because they are present in so many types of web pages. Things like section and article are nice, but are not used quite as frequently, and it is less clear cut when to use them.
<hr>
<h4>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h4>
Without any styling info, the browser shows the element on a page in the order they appear in the html code. For example, if the footer is included above the header in the code, the footer will be dispalyed above the header.

<h4>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h4>
I had made snippets before, but I learned about using default text in the snippet using ${1:default text}. I think I'll come up with more snippets in the future.
<hr>
<h4>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h4>
I thought it was pretty straight forward. Knowing exactly which semantic html to use can be challenging, or whether to use one at all. I think the flow chart is helpful, as will repeated practice.
