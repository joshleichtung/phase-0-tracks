# Assignment 9.3 Jquery Notes

## Plan of Attack
* I have used jQuery a little bit in the past, and am familiar with some of the basics, so my goal is to search for tutorials on two capabilities of jQuery that I haven't really used much before: jQuery UI and ajax requests in jQuery. I plan to look mostly at tutorials, so I will be trying things out as I go along.
* I'll break every 45 minutes.
* Test what I've learned after every break to make sure I can implement the
  things I've learned.
## What worked
* Written tutorials worked best for learning ajax, because it was relatively
  complicated. I definitely needed to stop and practice constantly to see if
what I was doing worked.
* For jQueryUI, it was much more simple, so a series of video tutorials really
  helped me understand how to do things like tabbed layout, accordion, etc...
